Addition (+):

The addition operator + is used to add two or more numbers together.
python

a = 5
b = 3
result = a + b
print(result)  # Output: 8

The subtraction operator - is used to subtract one number from another.
x = 10
y = 4
result = x - y
print(result)  # Output: 6


The multiplication operator * is used to multiply two or more numbers.
p = 7
q = 9
result = p * q
print(result)  # Output: 63

The division operator / is used to divide one number by another. In Python 3, it results in a floating-point division.
m = 10
n = 2
result = m / n
print(result)  # Output: 5.0

The power operator ** or the pow() function is used to raise a number to a specified power.
base = 2
exponent = 3
result = base ** exponent
print(result)  # Output: 8

You can also use the pow() function:
base = 2
exponent = 3
result = pow(base, exponent)
print(result)  # Output: 8

The math.sqrt() function from the math module is used to calculate the square root of a number.
import math

number = 25
result = math.sqrt(number)
print(result)  # Output: 5.0

: You need to import the math module to use math.sqrt().
