Addition (+):

The addition operator + is used to add two or more numbers together.
python
Copy code
a = 5
b = 3
result = a + b
print(result)  # Output: 8
Subtraction (-):

The subtraction operator - is used to subtract one number from another.
python
Copy code
x = 10
y = 4
result = x - y
print(result)  # Output: 6
Multiplication (*):

The multiplication operator * is used to multiply two or more numbers.
python
Copy code
p = 7
q = 9
result = p * q
print(result)  # Output: 63
Division (/):

The division operator / is used to divide one number by another. In Python 3, it results in a floating-point division.
python
Copy code
m = 10
n = 2
result = m / n
print(result)  # Output: 5.0
Power (Exponentiation) ( or pow())**:

The power operator ** or the pow() function is used to raise a number to a specified power.
python
Copy code
base = 2
exponent = 3
result = base ** exponent
print(result)  # Output: 8
You can also use the pow() function:

python
Copy code
base = 2
exponent = 3
result = pow(base, exponent)
print(result)  # Output: 8
Square Root (math.sqrt()):

The math.sqrt() function from the math module is used to calculate the square root of a number.
python
Copy code
import math

number = 25
result = math.sqrt(number)
print(result)  # Output: 5.0
Note: You need to import the math module to use math.sqrt().

These are some of the basic mathematical operations in Python. You can use these operations to perform a wide range of mathematical calculations in your Python programs.

Explain the concept of loops, including for and while loops, with examples.
Discuss loop control statements such as break and continue.

Loops are a fundamental concept in programming that allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code. They are used when you need to perform a specific task or a set of tasks multiple times without writing the same code over and over. In Python, there are mainly two types of loops: for loops and while loops. Additionally, there are loop control statements like break and continue that help control the flow of loops.

For Loop:
A for loop is used when you know how many times you want to execute a block of code. It iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and performs an action for each item in the sequence.

Example 1: Using a for loop to iterate through a list:

python
Copy code
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
Output:

Copy code
apple
banana
cherry
Example 2: Using a for loop with the range() function:

python
Copy code
for i in range(1, 5):  # Iterates from 1 to 4
    print(i)
Output:

Copy code
1
2
3
4
While Loop:
A while loop is used when you want to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

Example 3: Using a while loop to count from 1 to 5:

python
Copy code
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
Output:

Copy code
1
2
3
4
5
Loop Control Statements:
break Statement:
The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, even if the loop condition is still true. It's often used when a certain condition is met, and you want to terminate the loop immediately.

Example 4: Using break to exit a loop early:

python
Copy code
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == "banana":
        break
    print(fruit)
Output:

Copy code
apple
continue Statement:
The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next one. It's useful when you want to bypass certain items or conditions but continue the loop.

Example 5: Using continue to skip an iteration:

python
Copy code
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(num)
Output:

Copy code
1
3
5
In summary, loops, including for and while loops, are essential for repetitive tasks in programming. You can control the flow of loops using break to exit prematurely and continue to skip the current iteration and move to the next one. These constructs make your code more flexible and powerful for various tasks.

Define what functions are, how to declare them, and why they are useful.
Include examples of functions with parameters, return values, and different scopes.

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task or set of tasks. They are a fundamental concept in programming because they help organize code, promote code reusability, and make programs easier to understand and maintain.

Here's how you declare and use functions in Python, along with examples of functions with parameters, return values, and different scopes:

Declaring Functions:
In Python, you declare a function using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses (), and a colon :. The function body is indented and contains the code to be executed when the function is called.

python
Copy code
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")

# Calling the function
greet()
Output:

Copy code
Hello, world!
Functions with Parameters:
Functions can take parameters (also known as arguments) which are values passed to the function when it is called. Parameters allow functions to work with different data dynamically.

Example 1: Function with parameters:

python
Copy code
def greet_person(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Calling the function with an argument
greet_person("Alice")
Output:

Copy code
Hello, Alice!
Return Values:
Functions can also return values using the return keyword. This allows a function to provide a result or data back to the caller.

Example 2: Function with a return value:

python
Copy code
def add(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

# Calling the function and storing the result
sum_result = add(3, 5)
print(sum_result)  # Output: 8
Function Scopes:
Python has different scopes for variables, including local and global scopes. Variables defined inside a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed from outside. Global variables are defined outside any function and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.

Example 3: Function with local and global variables:

python
Copy code
global_var = 10

def my_function():
    local_var = 5
    print(f"Local variable: {local_var}")
    print(f"Global variable: {global_var}")

# Calling the function
my_function()

# Accessing the global variable
print(f"Global variable (outside the function): {global_var}")
Output:

sql
Copy code
Local variable: 5
Global variable: 10
Global variable (outside the function): 10
Why Functions Are Useful:
Modularity: Functions break down complex programs into smaller, more manageable pieces, making code more organized and easier to read.

Reusability: Once a function is defined, it can be used multiple times in different parts of your program, reducing code duplication.

Abstraction: Functions allow you to abstract away the implementation details and focus on the high-level functionality, making it easier to collaborate with others.

Debugging: Smaller functions are easier to test and debug because you can isolate and analyze specific parts of your code.

Scoping: Functions help manage variable scopes, preventing unintended side effects on global variables.

In summary, functions are a crucial aspect of programming that promote code organization, reusability, and abstraction, making it easier to build and maintain complex software systems.
