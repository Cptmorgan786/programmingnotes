# Glossary
**Variable:**
Example: age = 25
Definition: A variable is a container for storing data in a program. It has a name and can hold different types of data, such as numbers, text, or objects.
Input:

Example: name = input("Enter your name: ")
Definition: Input is a way to receive data from the user during program execution. In this example, the input function is used to read a line of text entered by the user.
**int:**

Example: x = 5
Definition: int is a data type that represents integers, which are whole numbers without a fractional or decimal part.
**float:**

Example: pi = 3.14
Definition: float is a data type that represents floating-point numbers, which can have decimal places.
**string:**

Example: message = "Hello, World!"
Definition: A string is a data type used to represent text or a sequence of characters.
**boolean:**

Example: is_valid = True
Definition: A boolean is a data type with only two possible values: True or False. It is often used for logical operations.
**Data Type:**

Example: str is a data type for strings, int is a data type for integers.
Definition: A data type defines the kind of data a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it.
**Type Conversion:**

Example: num_str = "5", num = int(num_str)
Definition: Type conversion is the process of changing the data type of a value from one type to another, such as converting a string to an integer.
**String Literal:**

Example: "Hello, World!"
Definition: A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in double or single quotes, used to represent string values directly in code.
**Arithmetic Operators:**

Example: +, -, *, /, %
Definition: Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations on numbers. For example, + adds two numbers together.
**Comparison Operators:**

Example: >, <, ==, !=
Definition: Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean result. For instance, > checks if the left value is greater than the right value.
**Logical Operators:**

Example: and, or, not
Definition: Logical operators perform logical operations on boolean values. and returns true if both operands are true.
**if, else, elif:**

Example:
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x == 10:
    print("x is equal to 10")
else:
    print("x is less than 10")

Definition: These are control flow statements in Python. if is used for conditional execution, elif stands for "else if," and else is executed if none of the preceding conditions are true.
**Lists:**

Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Definition: A list is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items. Items in a list can be of different data types.
**while loop:**

Example:
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

Definition: A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
**for loop:**

Example:
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

Definition: A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.
**break:**

Example:
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

Definition: break is a control flow statement used to exit a loop prematurely, typically based on a certain condition.

**Functions:**

Example:
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"

Definition: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It can take input parameters and return a result.
**PIP (Python Package Index):**

Example: pip install package_name
Definition: PIP is a package manager for Python that allows you to install and manage third-party libraries and packages easily. It simplifies the process of adding external functionality to your Python projects.
